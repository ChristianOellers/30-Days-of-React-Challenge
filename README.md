## About

Own adaption of the [30 Days of React Challenge](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-React).
Thank you, Asabeneh Yetayeh, for creating this course!

The code here focuses solely on React, TypeScript and node module features.
My personal focus is on architecture and communication design for production-grade web application setups.

The frontend is minimal to non-existent, as it's not relevant here.
It will run, but be warned that it's rather unpleasant to see :)


### Features

Deviating from the challenge

- Custom architecture: Separate UI components from layout and shareable helpers
- TypeScript integration
- SCSS integration
- Advanced linting â€“ ESlint, Flow, Stylint, HTMLhint
- Latest ES.next syntax (no respect to browser compatibility)

## How to use

I recommend focusing on the source code, not the running app.

### Setup

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org)

### Run

1. Install node + modules
2. Run `npm start`

<br><br>

## Todo

- Implement actual 404 (React default redirects to home, which is status code 200)
  - Use case: `fetch` API use needs to properly detect wrong URLs
